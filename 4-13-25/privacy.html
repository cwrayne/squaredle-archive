<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><em>We at Squaredle take your privacy very seriously. This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) tells you how we collect, store, use and share your personal information in accordance with various laws in the United States and, if you are in Europe or the United Kingdom, the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”). It also explains your rights and how contact us or supervisory authorities in the event you have a complaint.</em></p>

<p><em>When we refer to “personal information,” we mean any information that identifies an individual or could identify an individual.</em></p>

<p><em>Capitalized terms used but not defined in the Privacy Policy have the meanings given to them in our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Use</a>.</em></p>

<h2>Categories of personal information we collect</h2>

<p>We collect the following categories of personal information from you: identifiers (such as your username, the email address you used to sign up); commercial information (a record of your subscription(s) to our Services); internet and other network information (how you interact with our Services); location information (because your IP address may indicate your general location); and other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you. Payment processors that we may from time to time use may also collect financial information (your payment information and subscription history); you should refer to their privacy policies regarding how they handle personal information. We collect this information either when you provide it to us or automatically.</p>

<p><em>We have disclosed, and will continue to disclose, such information for the purposes discussed in “How and why we use personal information” and “Whom we share personal information with” below.</em></p>

<p><em>We have not sold any personal information within the past twelve months, nor do we intend to do so in the future.</em></p>

<h2>How we collect personal information</h2>

<p><em>Information you provide to us:</em></p>

  <li>We collect information about your use of our Services, including actions you take while playing our games, your scores and your game history.</li>
  <li>If you subscribe for any paid services (like our ad-free “Squaredle Squared” version), you may need to submit a valid payment method and associated billing information, including your name and billing address, as required by our third-party payment processors. In such instances, the privacy policies of such third-party processors will govern how your personal information is handled.</li>
  <li>If you choose to leave Feedback through our Site, we collect certain personal information associated with that Feedback. If you submit Feedback though a third-party Community Space, your information will be handled in accordance with the privacy policies of such Community Space.</li>
</ul>

  <li>We may also receive information from cookies (small text files place on your computer or device) and similar technologies. Cookies are placed by us, or our third-party service providers, and allow you to use the Services and to help us analyze and improve your experience and the Services.

<h2>How and why we use personal information</h2>

<ul>
  <li>to provide our Services to you in accordance with the Terms of Use, contact you and provide customer support</li>
  <li>for our legitimate business interests, including:
    <ul>
      <li>keeping our services secure, preventing misuse and enforcing the Terms of Use</li>
      <li>monitoring and improving our Services</li>
      <li>selecting ads for users</li>
      <li>promoting our Services (please see “Promotional communications” below)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>to comply with our legal obligations
    <ul>
      <li>for example, we may retain and use your information in connection with potential legal claims when necessary and for compliance, regulatory and auditing purposes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>with your consent</li>
</ul>

<h2>Promotional communications</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If you register for our Services and give your consent, we may use your email address to send you emails about your Squaredle performance and, rarely, to contact you about Squaredle promotions. These emails will provide links to unsubscribe from future emails.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Whom we share personal information with</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We share your personal information with third parties only when we are satisfied that they take appropriate measures to protect it.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>We use the services of Playwire, which uses cookies and similar technology to analyze usage and optimize ad placement. We may in the future work with other third-party service providers for these purposes. As noted above, you can disable and manage some cookies through your browser settings. If you are in the European Union or the UK, you may specifically disable cookies by use-type or third-party service provider. If you a non-EU/UK user, you may use tools such as browser settings, browser extensions, or industry opt-out websites like <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1">NAI</a> to opt out of all cookies.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>We share personal information that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we use Google Analytics in anonymized mode to measure engagement. We also use Google Analytics Advertising Features to better understand our users. You can opt out of Google Analytics entirely. Either add Google’s official <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Opt-out Browser Add-on</a> or use an ad-blocker.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>We may disclose and exchange information with law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>We may share personal information if we are evaluating and/or engaging in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale, transfer or change in ownership of Squaredle or its assets. Parties with whom we share information in such instances will be obligated to keep such information confidential.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where personal information is held, and for how long:</h2>	

<ul>
  <li>We are based in the United States, and we process and store information on servers located in the United States. We may also store information on servers and equipment in other countries depending on a variety of factors, but do not do so at this time. By accessing or using our services, or otherwise providing information to us, you understand that your information will be processed, transferred, and stored in the United States and potentially other countries, where different data protection standards may apply and/or you may not have the same rights as you would under your local law.</li>
</ul>	

<ul>
  <li>We retain personal information for as long as it is needed for the purposes for which we collect it. If your account has been inactive for more than one year, we may delete it, and we may delete or anonymize any personal information associated with our account.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Transparency, queries, deletion</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Please also let us know (by submitting feedback from the “Send Feedback” page or by writing to us at hello@squaredle.app) if you have any queries or concerns about how we handle personal information. You may request (by the same means) to see what information we have about you, in which case you should receive a data packet within approximately 30 days, delivered in a common digital format. You may also request (by the same means) that we delete any data that we have about you. This will not remove data stored locally on your device, and it may prevent parts of the site (for example, your leaderboard stats) from working properly for you since the server will no longer recognize your device.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>If you are in Europe or the United Kingdom, the GDPR gives you the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority in the country where you work, normally live, or where you believe infringement of data protection laws has occurred.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Privacy Policy changes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Squaredle may change this Privacy Policy from time to time in its sole discretion. We encourage you to check this page frequently for changes to our Privacy Policy. Your continued use of our Services after any changes will constitute your acceptance of them.</li>
