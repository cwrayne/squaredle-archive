  <h2>What is Squaredle Beta?</h2>
  <p>Squaredle Beta is where new Squaredle features and fixes start first.</p>
  <p>To access Squaredle Beta, update your bookmarks to
    <a href="beta/index.htm">squaredle.app/beta</a>.</p>
  <p>Or, if you launch the main site while you're part of the beta, you'll receive
    a pop-up asking if you want to continue to the beta site.</p>
  <h2>How can I tell when I'm using the beta?</h2>
  <p>Check the Settings menu in Squaredle, or see if the version number in the
    lower left ends with "beta".</p>
  <h2>What is the preview puzzle?</h2>
  <p>The puzzle piece icon in the top left of Squaredle shows up when a preview
    puzzle is available. Click it to switch between the preview puzzle and the
    regular daily puzzle.</p>
  <p>The preview puzzle is a sneak peek of a future daily puzzle. It's usually
    released about once per week, though it's been less often lately.
    Please try them out and leave feedback! That
    helps us gauge how difficult the puzzle is (what rating it should have, and
    what day of the week it belongs in.)</p>
  <p>Sometimes the preview puzzle has new features I'm experimenting with.</p>
  <h2>How do I leave feedback?</h2>
  <p>Ideally, in the beta channel in the
    <a href="https://discord.gg/Pkad9p4rsq" target="_blank">Squaredle Discord</a>.
    To help us troubleshoot,
    we may ask you to send feedback in-game: tap the question mark icon in the
    top right and open the Feedback tab.</p>
  <h2>Where can I discuss Squaredle Beta?</h2>
  <p>Join the
    <a href="https://discord.gg/Pkad9p4rsq" target="_blank">Squaredle Discord</a>
    and private message "Kayghzee" to get access to the beta discussion
    channel.
  </p>
  <h2>Can I share Squaredle Beta with my friends?</h2>
  <p>No, please don't share details about experimental features or screenshots of
    the preview puzzle.</p>
  <p>We periodically open the Beta up to members on our
    <a href="https://discord.gg/Pkad9p4rsq" target="_blank">Discord server</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>How do I leave or rejoin the beta?</h2>
  <p>If you're having problems with the beta site, please send feedback!</p>
  <p>If you want to temporarily leave the beta, simply opt out in Settings.</p>
  <p>You can always opt back in later.</p>
